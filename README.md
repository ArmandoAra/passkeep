A simple password manager written in Dart.

While a was learning Dart and Flutter in Udemy with Angela yu,
I decided to write a simple password manager to practice my skills.
This app saves the passwords in a local database using the local storage package, and
have not any encryption, so it is not recommended to use it to store sensitive data,
it is just a practice project.

## Features
- Login with fingerprint or Pin
- Add, Edit, Delete and View passwords
